<!-- This file registers new types with portal_types. The types are
     then configured with the corresponding files in types/*.xml. Note
     that spaces are allowed in type names, but the corresponding XML file
     uses an underscore instead. The "Factory-based Type Information with
     dynamic views" refers to an FTI from Products.CMFDynamicViewFTI,
     which supports Plone's "display" menu.
